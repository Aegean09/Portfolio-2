              In life, what I believe is you have to take every opportunity to add something to yourself. Since university I started to have a keen interest on pushing myself to the next level, forcing my foot on the next step of the ladder. Seeing what I can do and what I can improve myself on and the amazement my family feels in things I do is what keeps me going.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in 14/12/1999 Aydin Nazilli to a family of a teacher father, a housewife mother and a brother that 7 years older than me. In preschool, I was always trying to be 1 step ahead of the teacher. If she was teaching us "How to make origami animals", I would go like "Ok I can do this without her guidance" which almost all the time resulted in different from what she was making. Yet still I don't see it as a failure because I learned something from it<span id="dots">...</span>
              <span id="more"><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Elementary School I was both one of the brightest though I was never a teacher's pet. I always respected my teachers. I was not the quite kid when it came to talking to teachers. My brain was highly open to learn new things from teachers and help my student with what I learned from them. That's why they were choosing me as class' president. I learned how to be kind towards others and how to keep my cool during stressfull situations. In highschool, in teacher's eyes I was one of the loved. I was doing well with my subjects and was respectful to my teachers. But one time
                  there was this teacher yelling at us in class for something that we were actual innocent. I stood up for the class that day and told him to reconsider his ability to judge people. He got so frustrated but 2 days later apologized me and the class. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept my attitude towards teachers even in university. Also I started to understand that I had to take whatever I can from the life. I joined every club that my uni can offer. Even though I had 4 medals in basketball, I was eager to try different sports. I made friends from all over Turkey. I worked hard to keep my GPA above 3.30 to join Erasmus+. Even I stayed up in library for 2 days because I had to study. I was one of the top in the list of Erasmus+ applicants, this meant I 
                  could choose wherever I'd like to spend my Erasmus. I went Czech Republic, Brno. My goal was "I will try anything and everything" which I accomplished in the end. I travelled 8 countries all alone because I didn't want to get limited by what my friends wants and what I want. I lived fully in Erasmus. After that when I came to Turkey pandemic was at beginning stages yet. Due to pandemic we had to start learning from online classes which actually didn't go well for any of us. Now we are still getting online education, hopefully next semester it will be over. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My interest in software development started way before university. I tried C and Python languages in highschool made simple applications with what I learned from Youtube. In university, I started with C language and later I was introduced to Java, HTML/CSS, JS, Bootstrap, PhP. I'm working to teach myself with Udemy and YouTube. 
                  Currently I am doing my first internship with GittiGidiyor as a Frontend Developer. I'm hunting for an opportunity to cause a change in the website. And this website is a Project both to refresh my HTML/CSS JS skills and learn new stuff like Firebase, GitLab. </span>
